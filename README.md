# Boilerplate of Node, React, and GraphQL


A few steps to set up the boilerplate. Please install packages for server and client side as below.


## Server
The project is run in Node.js and Express. See ./server folder.

Go to ./server, and `npm install` to install server packages, including `express`, `graphql` and `apollo-server-express`.


## Client
Front end uses React.js, and in ./client folder.

Go to ./client, and `npm install` to install client packages, including `react`, `apollo-boost`, and `react-apollo`.


Go to the project root folder, `npm run dev` to start the project, including frond end React and back end Node.


Front end: http://localhost:3000

GraphQL playground: http://localhost:4444/graphql (check the endpoint in ./server/server.js)
